# Contrail Publisher configuration
#
# This configuration describes a process of copying artifacts
# from public per-review registry into the public ci-repo one.
#
# The build registry url can be overridden from the command
# line by passing `--build-override 10.84.5.81:port`

registries:
  - name: build
    url: 10.84.5.81:32000
    source: True
    untrusted: True
  - name: ci-repo-public
    url: 10.84.5.81:5000

# Image overrides:
#
# Overrides can be used to change the behavior on the per-image basis. This
# can be used to implement custom tagging for RHEL, select which registries
# to push images to etc.
#
# Currently supported keys are:
#
#   - `image_matcher`
#   - `tag_matcher`
#   - `registries`
#   - `release_tags`
#   - `source_tag`
#   - `distribution`
